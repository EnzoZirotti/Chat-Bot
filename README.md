# Chat-Bot

A basic chatbot in process to understand the creation and and user interaction with backend precoded responce using NLP to make it easier to interact with.
This chatbot shows that in the backend process you must use a manual input of reponces to the interaction you are expecting which shows that in the case of chatbot use there are very based opinions still coded in. The idea to eliminate that would be to use machine learning models to help lessen the based answers but would need a limiter to make sure this is not reaching hate speech.
